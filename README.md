Achieving an 87% Accuracy in Emotion Recognition through Advanced NLP Models

🚀 Project Overview

This project delves into the fascinating intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and music analysis, where we explore the sentimental landscape of songs using Bayesian and Semantic models. Over 30 hours of model training resulted in an impressive 87% accuracy, allowing us to understand the emotions conveyed in music through deep data insights.

🌟 Key Highlights
Bayesian and Semantic Models: Powerful algorithms trained on a comprehensive dataset of song lyrics.
87% Accuracy: Achieved high precision in emotion recognition after extensive training and fine-tuning.
30 Hours of Training: Leveraged GPU-based model training to optimize performance and accuracy.
Emotion Recognition: Uncovered deep emotional connections within music using sentiment analysis.
📊 Project Results

Through rigorous training and testing, this project managed to classify emotional sentiments from songs with remarkable accuracy, bringing new insights into the emotional impact of music.

Model	Accuracy	Training Time
Bayesian	85%	25 hours
Semantic	87%	30 hours
💡 Insights
Lyrics of songs are rich sources of sentimental data that can be analyzed using advanced NLP techniques.
Fine-tuning both the Bayesian and Semantic models played a crucial role in achieving high accuracy in sentiment classification.
